# Hello World Program in Python
In this repository I'm covered "Hello World" program in Python.

## Let's break down the Python code line by line

```bash
print("Hello world")
```

```bash
print() // function
```

## print()
is a built-in Python function used to output (or print) text to the console or terminal.


## "Hello world"
is a string literal. In Python (and many other programming languages), a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes (").
The string "Hello world" consists of the characters H, e, l, l, o,  , w, o, r, l, and d,.
This string literal represents the famous phrase "Hello world", often used as the first program output in introductory programming examples.


## Execution
When you execute this line of code in a Python interpreter or script, the print() function will output the specified string to the console or terminal window.

## The output will be exactly
```bash
Hello world
```

In summary, the provided Python code print("Hello world") simply prints the text "Hello world" to the screen. It's a straightforward demonstration of how to use the print() function in Python to display text output.


Thank You.
